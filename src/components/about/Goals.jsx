      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        As I continue to grow and evolve, I have set several personal and
        professional goals for the next five yearsthat guide my journey:
      </p>
      <h3>1. Career Growth & Creative Fulfillment</h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        I’m working as a designer at a local start-up where I feel confident in
        what I create and excited to share my work with others. I’m taking on
        projects that challenge and fulfill me, while continuing to learn new
        skills that I can use and showcase.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> 2. Personal Well-Being & Balance </h3>
      <p>
        I’ve built a stable lifestyle that gives me time to spend with the
        people I care about. I’ve developed a routine that supports both my
        physical and mental health, and I’ve become more confident in setting
        boundaries and honoring my own needs.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> 3. Community & Connection </h3>
      <p>
        I feel more connected to the local communities in Vancouver and have
        grown my network meaningfully. I regularly make time to reconnect with
        nature and continue exploring my passion for music—maybe even by playing
        at open mics again.
