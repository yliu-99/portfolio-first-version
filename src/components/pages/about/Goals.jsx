            As I continue to grow and evolve, I have set several personal and
            professional goals for the next five years that guide my journey:

            <h3>Career Growth & Creative Fulfillment</h3>
            <p>
              I'm working as a designer at a local start-up where I feel confident in
              what I create and excited to share my work with others. I'm taking on
              projects that challenge and fulfill me, while continuing to learn new
              skills that I can use and showcase.
            </p>

          <div className="goal-item">
            <h3>Personal Well-Being & Balance</h3>
            <p>
              I've built a stable lifestyle that gives me time to spend with the
              people I care about. I've developed a routine that supports both my
              physical and mental health, and I've become more confident in setting
              boundaries and honoring my own needs.
            </p>

          <div className="goal-item">
            <h3>Community & Connection</h3>
            <p>
              I feel more connected to the local communities in Vancouver and have
              grown my network meaningfully. I regularly make time to reconnect with
              nature and continue exploring my passion for music—maybe even by playing
              at open mics again.
