            <p>Hi, I'm Yuhan. I am a <span className="highlight-primary">multidisciplinary designer</span>, and I use creativity as my way of connecting with the world. Currently studying as a New Media Design and Web Development student at BCIT, I am excited to spend each day learning new ways of bringing ideas to life through design, code, and storytelling. Whether I'm building a brand, filming creative content, designing sound environments, or creating striking motion graphics, I always aim to make something that feels <span className="highlight-accent">meaningful</span>. My biggest inspirations come from film, video games, and music, as well as the storytelling within these mediums that <span className="highlight-accent">evokes feelings</span>, both vulnerable and beautiful, in people.</p>

            <p>Before shifting into tech and design, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in <span className="highlight-secondary">Music Performance</span> and also spent two years working as a <span className="highlight-secondary">private voice teacher</span>. These experiences have strengthened my understanding of communication, connection, emotion, and narrative, which I carry into all my creative projects today.</p>

            <p>Outside of school and work, I recharge by making music, spending quality time with loved ones, playing video games, cooking, exploring photography, and crafting things by hand. These little joys help me stay <span className="highlight-accent">curious</span>, <span className="highlight-accent">grounded</span>, and <span className="highlight-accent">inspired</span> in everything I do.</p>
